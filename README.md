# File Quality Checker
Simple tool to check basic problems in files like HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, CSV, and SQL.

## Why I made it
I usually work with many files and sometimes they have small mistakes.
I wanted something simple that tells me quickly if something might be wrong.

## How to install
```
npm install -g file-quality-checker
```

## How to use
Go inside your project folder then run:

```
fqc
```

It will check all supported files and print warnings if needed.
